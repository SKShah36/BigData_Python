For this assignment, you will need the same text file (`Shakespeare.txt`) and Python tokenizer module, `simple_tokenize.py`, that you used for the first two assignments.    You will also use the same definition of PMI that was used for [Assignment 1](https://roegiest.com/bigdata-2019w/assignment1-431.html).\n",
